## Day 3 - Polish & Final Submission (Wednesday, Oct 29)

### PR #9: Bug Fixes & UI Polish
**Branch:** `fix/ui-polish`  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started

**Description:** Fix critical bugs from MVP testing. Improve UI/UX and add quality-of-life features.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Fix any bugs discovered in MVP testing
- [ ] Improve layout and spacing (TailwindCSS)
- [ ] Add loading states for async operations
- [ ] Improve error messages (user-friendly)
- [ ] Add tooltips or help text
- [ ] Improve timeline zoom/scroll UX
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts (Space = play/pause)
- [ ] Add delete clip from timeline
- [ ] Improve drag-and-drop visual feedback
- [ ] Optimize performance (if issues found)

#### Files Modified:
```
📝 src/components/MediaLibrary.tsx (improve layout)
📝 src/components/Timeline.tsx (improve interactions)
📝 src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx (improve controls)
📝 src/components/ExportControls.tsx (improve UX)
📝 src/index.css (improve global styles)
```

#### Features to Add:

**1. Loading States**
```typescript
// src/components/MediaLibrary.tsx
const [isImporting, setIsImporting] = useState(false);

const handleImport = async () => {
  setIsImporting(true);
  try {
    await importVideo();
  } finally {
    setIsImporting(false);
  }
};

return (
  <button disabled={isImporting}>
    {isImporting ? 'Importing...' : 'Import Video'}
  </button>
);
```

**2. Keyboard Shortcuts**
```typescript
// src/App.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyPress = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.code === 'Space') {
      e.preventDefault();
      isPlaying ? pause() : play();
    }
    if (e.code === 'Delete' && selectedClip) {
      removeClip(selectedClip.id);
    }
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
}, [isPlaying, selectedClip]);
```

**3. Better Error Messages**
```typescript
// Replace generic errors with user-friendly messages
const errorMessages = {
  unsupported_format: 'This video format is not supported. Please use MP4 or MOV files.',
  drm_protected: 'This video is DRM-protected and cannot be imported.',
  file_too_large: 'This file is too large. Maximum size is 4GB.',
  corrupted: 'This video file appears to be corrupted. Please try a different file.',
  no_permission: 'Cannot access this file. Please check file permissions.',
};
```

**4. Visual Feedback Improvements**
```typescript
// Hover states for timeline clips
<Rect
  onMouseEnter={() => setHoveredClip(clip.id)}
  onMouseLeave={() => setHoveredClip(null)}
  fill={hoveredClip === clip.id ? '#5A9FE2' : '#4A90E2'}
  stroke={selectedClip === clip.id ? '#FFA500' : 'transparent'}
  strokeWidth={3}
/>
```

**5. Disable Buttons During Operations**
```typescript
// src/components/ExportControls.tsx
<button 
  onClick={handleExport}
  disabled={isExporting || timelineClips.length === 0}
  className={`
    ${isExporting ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed' : 'hover:bg-blue-600'}
    bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded
  `}
>
  {isExporting ? `Exporting... ${progress}%` : 'Export Video'}
</button>
```

#### Validation:
- [ ] All buttons have proper hover states
- [ ] Loading states show during async operations
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work (Space, Delete)
- [ ] App feels responsive and polished
- [ ] No console errors during normal usage
- [ ] Buttons disabled appropriately during operations
